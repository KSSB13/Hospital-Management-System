# Hospital-Management-System

The Hospital Management System presented is a console-based application designed to streamline essential operations within a medical facility. The program allows users to register patients, schedule appointments, retrieve patient data, and manage doctor records. The patient and doctor information is stored in organized data structures such as Red-Black Trees and linked lists.

Patients can be registered with details like name, health issues, and emergency contacts. Appointments can be scheduled, taking into account doctor specializations, and the system ensures the availability of doctors for a given health issue. The program offers functionality to save and load patient data from a file, providing a means of data persistence.

The menu-driven interface allows users to navigate through different options seamlessly. Doctors are initialized at the start of the program, and their specializations are mapped to ensure efficient appointment scheduling. The system incorporates error handling for scenarios such as invalid input and ensures a user-friendly experience.

With features like patient search by name and the ability to manage appointments efficiently, the Hospital Management System provides a foundation for further enhancements. While the current version is console-based, it serves as a functional prototype that can be expanded to include additional features for comprehensive hospital management.
